# Simple song-book progressive web app

_Status: Draft._

_Disclaimer: This is not an official Google product._

## Purpose

The application allows users to browse and display songs from a supplied list.

On mobile devices it behaves like a native application (so-called [progressive
web app][1]) and allows offline use by caching songs in the device's storage.

In addition, it can be viewed in any standard browser as a regular web page.

Songs are supplied as server-side static content together with a JSON index
document.
